Our project involves scraping tweets related to the COVID Vaccine. 
We are looking for you to help us identify which of the scraped tweets are actually indicative of a user receiving the vaccine.
Each HIT contains 12 tweets, and we are asking you to select all of the tweets which indicate that a user received a vaccine. 
If none of the tweets indicate that a user received a vaccine, select "No tweets about getting COVID vaccine".

### Important Notes:
- Select yes regardless of whether a user received their 1st or 2nd dose.
- It does not matter what brand of vaccine they received (Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, etc.)
- If a user is tweeting about one of their friends/family receiving the vaccine, you should still select yes.

Here are some examples of "yes" tweets and "no" tweets.

#### Yes Tweets

This is clearly about a user receiving a vaccine, especially since they've attached an image of their vaccine card.

This is a yes tweet, because the user is indicating that her husband has just received the vaccine.



#### No Tweets

This is a no tweet, as the tweet is just about new CDC guidelines surrounding the vaccine.

This is a no tweet as well, because the tweet is discussing news about the J&J vaccine.
